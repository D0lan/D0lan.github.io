The idea for this site has been brewing like a storm. As a researcher in **neuromorphic computing**, I'm constantly inspired by the elegance of natural systems — the way neurons fire, the way raindrops trace patterns down a window pane. I wanted a personal website that captured that same feeling of peering into another world.

On this site you'll find:

* **About** – learn more about my background and interests.
* **Projects** – dive into my research and side projects.
* **Album** – browse photos and videos from my adventures and experiments.
* **Blog** – read posts on neuromorphic computing, technology, nature and whatever else I feel like exploring.

The rain effect you see in the background isn't a simple CSS animation — it uses the [RainyDay.js](https://github.com/maroslaw/RainyDay.js/) library to simulate real raindrops sliding down a pane of glass. I initially explored a more complex WebGL effect from Codrops【435862195596346†L0-L14】, but ultimately opted for a lighter solution that still feels authentic. If you're curious about how it's implemented, check out the `script.js` file in the source.

I hope you enjoy the atmosphere and find something of value here. Let me know what you think, and stay tuned for more updates!
