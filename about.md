  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Aryan and I’m a PhD student at the University at Buffalo researching neuromorphic computing. I design brain‑inspired hardware and algorithms that enable efficient, adaptive and low‑power intelligence. My work spans spiking neural networks, memristive devices and the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.</p>
  <p>When I’m not immersed in research, I enjoy exploring nature with my camera, tinkering on side projects and writing about the ideas that spark my curiosity.</p>
